# Diaper Size analysis
TEAM BIG BRAIN's submission for **Hacking the diaper** hackathon by Kimberly-Clark<br>
## Problem statement
Based on a recent “fit” study, almost one-third of diaper users wear the wrong diaper size, while four out of ten mothers state that diaper fit is a significant concern at every stage of diapering. Despite disposable diapers being around for the last half-century, ensuring proper fit of diapers for babies can be confusing for parents. When babies wear the wrong diaper size, the chances of leakage and blowouts increase. Kimberly-Clark continues to partner with parents to not just provide a diaper that fits their baby perfectly, but also provide the technology and tools needed to reduce diaper fit challenges.<br>
## Objective
This project is aimed to provide a reliable solution for the parents to for the correct diaper size and predict change of diaper size upon future based on our AI/ML algorithm and AR technology.
